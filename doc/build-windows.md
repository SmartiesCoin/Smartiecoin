WINDOWS BUILD NOTES
====================

Some notes on how to build Smartiecoin Core for Windows.

Most developers use cross-compilation from Ubuntu to build executables for
Windows. This is also used to build the release binaries.

Building on Windows itself is possible (for example using msys / mingw-w64),
but no one documented the steps to do this. If you are doing this, please contribute them.

Cross-compilation
-------------------

These steps can be performed on, for example, an Ubuntu VM. The depends system
will also work on other Linux distributions, however the commands for
installing the toolchain will be different.

First install the toolchains:

    sudo apt-get install g++-mingw-w64-i686 mingw-w64-i686-dev g++-mingw-w64-x86-64 mingw-w64-x86-64-dev
    
Ubuntu Bionic 18.04 <sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup>:

    sudo update-alternatives --config x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++ # 64 Bit Windows - Set the default to posix.
    sudo update-alternatives --config i686-w64-mingw32-g++ # 32 Bit Windows - Set the default to posix.

Once the toolchain is installed the build steps are common:

Note that for WSL the Smartiecoin Core source path MUST be somewhere in the default mount file system, for
example /usr/src/swmp, AND not under /mnt/d/. If this is not the case the dependency autoconf scripts will fail.
This means you cannot use a directory that is located directly on the host Windows file system to perform the build.

Build 64 bit windows binaries using:

    PATH=$(echo "$PATH" | sed -e 's/:\/mnt.*//g') # strip out problematic Windows %PATH% imported var
    cd depends
    make HOST=x86_64-w64-mingw32 # 64 bit windows
    cd ..
    ./autogen.sh # not required when building from tarball
    CONFIG_SITE=$PWD/depends/x86_64-w64-mingw32/share/config.site ./configure --prefix=/
    make
    
Build 32 bit windows binaries using:

    PATH=$(echo "$PATH" | sed -e 's/:\/mnt.*//g') # strip out problematic Windows %PATH% imported var
    cd depends
    make HOST=i686-w64-mingw32 # 32 bit windows
    cd ..
    ./autogen.sh # not required when building from tarball
    CONFIG_SITE=$PWD/depends/i686-w64-mingw32/share/config.site ./configure --prefix=/
    make
    
Installation
-------------

After building using the Windows subsystem it can be useful to copy the compiled
executables to a directory on the Windows drive in the same directory structure
as they appear in the release `.zip` archive. This can be done in the following
way. This will install to `c:\workspace\bitcoin`, for example:

    make install DESTDIR=/mnt/c/workspace/smartiecoin # or any other folder name you like

You can also create an installer using:

    make deploy

To build executables for Windows 32-bit:

    cd depends
    make HOST=i686-w64-mingw32 -j4
    cd ..
    ./configure --prefix=`pwd`/depends/i686-w64-mingw32
    make

To build executables for Windows 64-bit:

    cd depends
    make HOST=x86_64-w64-mingw32 -j4
    cd ..
    ./configure --prefix=`pwd`/depends/x86_64-w64-mingw32
    make

For further documentation on the depends system see [README.md](../depends/README.md) in the depends directory.

Footnotes
---------

<a name="footnote1">1</a>: Starting from Ubuntu Xenial 16.04, both the 32 and 64 bit Mingw-w64 packages install two different
compiler options to allow a choice between either posix or win32 threads. The default option is win32 threads which is the more
efficient since it will result in binary code that links directly with the Windows kernel32.lib. Unfortunately, the headers
required to support win32 threads conflict with some of the classes in the C++11 standard library, in particular std::mutex.
It's not possible to build the Smartiecoin Core code using the win32 version of the Mingw-w64 cross compilers (at least not without
modifying headers in the Smartiecoin Core source code).
